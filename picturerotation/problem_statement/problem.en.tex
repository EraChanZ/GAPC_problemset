Pictures are beautiful, and they look even better if you rotate them!

You have a picture, which has a shape of rectangle with the sides $w$ and $h$. Every day you rotate the picture for 1 degree. As you rotate the picture, you observe its bounding box - the smallest rectangle with the sides parallel to the axes that fully contains the rotated picture. 

You've noticed that the area of bounding box is often bigger than the area of the picture. Given $w$, $h$ and the day $d$, find the difference between these areas.

\begin{Input}
    The input consists of one line containing three space separated integers:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Picture width $w$ ($\mina \leq w\leq \maxa$).
        \item Picture height $h$ ($\mina \leq h\leq \maxa$).
        \item Number of days $d$ ($\minn \leq d\leq \maxn$).
    \end{itemize}
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
    Print the difference between the area of the bounding box and the area of the picture after $d$ days.
    Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.
\end{Output}
