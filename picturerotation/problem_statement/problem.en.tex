You have a picture, which looks like a rectangle with the sides W and H. Every day you rotate the picture for 1 degree. As you rotate the picture, you observe its bounding box - the smallest rectangle with the sides parallel to the axes that contains the rotated picture. 

You've noticed that the area of bounding box is often bigger than the area of the picture. Given W, H and the day N, print the difference between the areas.

\begin{Input}
    The input consists of one line containing three space separated integers:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Picture width $W$ ($\mina \leq W\leq \maxa$).
        \item Picture height $H$ ($\mina \leq H\leq \maxa$).
        \item Number of days $N$ ($\minn \leq N\leq \maxn$).
    \end{itemize}
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
    Output the difference between the area of the bounding box and the area of the picture.
    Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.
\end{Output}
