Prime numbers are great, and it's even greater to have several of them together!

Let's say that a nice number is a number that can be represented as a concatenation of one or more prime numbers. For example, 1319 is a nice number, because it can be split into primes 13 and 19. At the same time, 393 or 24 aren't nice.

Given a number $n$, say whether it's a nice one.

\begin{Input}
    The input consists of one line containing a single integer $n$ ($\minn\leq n\leq \maxn$).
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
    Print YES if the number is nice and print NO otherwise.
\end{Output}
