N people are playing a game: they throw a dice with M sides. They do it in order: person 1, person 2, ... person N, person 1 again, person 2 again and so on. The first one to see the side "1" wins.
For each person, what is the probability to win?

\begin{Input}
    The input consists of one line containing two integers:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Number of people $N$ ($\minn \leq N\leq \maxn$).
        \item Number of dice sides $M$ ($\minm \leq M\leq \maxm$).
    \end{itemize}
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
    Print $N$ space separated floating point numbers: winning chances of each person.
    Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.
\end{Output}
