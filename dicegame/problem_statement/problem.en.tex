Playing games is fun, and it's even more fun when everyone has a chance to win!

There are $n$ people playing a game. They throw a dice with $m$ sides showing numbers from 1 to $m$. The player who rolls the side 1 immediately wins.

The players go in order: player 1, player 2 and so on. If nobody wins after $n$ turns, player 1 goes again.

For each player calculate the probability to win the game.

\begin{Input}
    The input consists of one line containing two integers:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Number of players $n$ ($\minn \leq n\leq \maxn$).
        \item Number of dice sides $m$ ($\minm \leq m\leq \maxm$).
    \end{itemize}
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
    Print $n$ space separated floating point numbers: winning chances of each player.
    Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.
\end{Output}
