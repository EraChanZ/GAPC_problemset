Strong password has the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item 8 to 16 character long.
\item Contains at least one lower case letter.
\item Contains at least one upper case letter.
\item Contains at least one digit.
\end{itemize}

Some passwords are already strong, but some passwords can get strong by adding just one character.
Given a password, is it possible to turn it into a strong one by appending at most one character?

\begin{Input}
    The input consists of one line containing a single string $pwd$ ($\minlen \leq len(pwd)\leq \maxlen$), the password.
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
    Print YES if it's possible to turn the password into a strong one by appending at most one character, otherwise print NO.
\end{Output}
