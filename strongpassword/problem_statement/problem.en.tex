Passwords are important, and it's even more important to keep your passwords strong!

Let's call a password strong if it matches the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Has length between 8 and 16 characters.
\item Contains at least one lower case letter.
\item Contains at least one upper case letter.
\item Contains at least one digit.
\end{itemize}

Some passwords are already strong; some other passwords can become strong after adding more letters or digits.
Given a password, is it possible to turn it into a strong one by appending at most one character?

\begin{Input}
    The input is a single line containing password $p$. The given password consists of Latin characters and digits and has a length between $\minlen$ and $\maxlen$ characters.
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
    Print YES if the password is already strong or can become strong after appending one character, otherwise print NO.
\end{Output}
