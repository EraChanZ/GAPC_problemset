Problem name: Make the teams
Estimated difficulty (1=very easy, 10=very hard): 2
    In the past, when Gandalf was fighting Darth Vader, there happened to be a GAPC edition 0, and there were 3 problems. One was about dynamic programming, the second one was about graphs and the last one was about number theory. There were teams that were formed by 1 or 2 students. Because of very advanced machine learning algorithms, they could precisely say how difficult is a problem, by assessing it a difficulty value. Moreover, they knew also how capable is a student at solving a kind of a problem, by using the precise power of the random number generator. In the end, tell us if it was possible to organise the students in teams of 1 or 2 students, in such a way that all the teams coudl have solved at least 2 problems at that contest. 
    In order to solve a problem, a student must have a score for that kind of problem that is at least equal to the difficulty of the problem. The problems that can be solved have to be different.

	Input format:
    First line, three numbers, a, b, c which represents the difficulty for the dynamic programming problem, the graphs problem and the number theory one, in this order. 0<=a,b,c<=10^10
    Second line, represents the number of students, N,  that participated in the contest.  1<=N<=10^6
    N lines, that contain 3 numbers, x,y,z  which represent the knowledge level for the dynamic programming problem, the graphs problem and the number theory one, in this order. 0<=x,y,z<=10^10

    Output format:
    Print yes, if it is possible to organise the students in teams of 1 or 2, such that to solve at least two problems in the contest, otherwise print no
