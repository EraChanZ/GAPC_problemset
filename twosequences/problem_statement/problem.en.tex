You are given two increasing sequences of integers with sizes $N$ and $M$. Choose $K$ elements from the first sequence and $K-1$ elements from the second sequence in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The resulting elements should form an increasing sequence
    \item The elements interleave, like A B A B A B A B A
    \item The minimal difference between any two resulting elements is as large as possible
\end{itemize}

Print the largest possible minimal difference.

\begin{Input}
    The input consists of three lines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First line containing three space separated integers $N$, $M$ and $K$ ($\minn \leq N\leq \maxn$, $\minm \leq M\leq \maxm$, $\mink \leq K\leq \maxk$, $K \leq N$, $K-1 \leq M$).
        \item Second line containing $N$ increasing elements of the first sequence. Each element is an integer between \mina and \maxa.
        \item Third line containing $M$ increasing elements of the second sequence. Each element is an integer between \mina and \maxa.
    \end{itemize}
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
    Output one integer number: the largest possible minimal difference between the elements of the resulting sequence.
\end{Output}
