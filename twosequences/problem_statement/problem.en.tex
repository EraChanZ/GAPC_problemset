Sequences are exciting, and they become even more exciting when you merge them together!

You are given two non-decreasing sequences of integers with sizes $n$ and $m$. Merge their elements into a new sequence in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choose $k$ elements from the first sequence and $k-1$ elements from the second sequence
    \item Join the chosen elements so that they interleave, like A B A B A B A
    \item The resulting elements should form a non-decreasing sequence
\end{itemize}

After the merge you want the resulting elements to be as far from each other as possible.

Let's say that $distance$ is the minimal difference between any two resulting elements. Your goal is to choose the elements in a way that maximises the $distance$.

Find and print the largest possible $distance$. If it's not possible to form any non-decreasing sequence, print $-1$.

\begin{Input}
    The input consists of three lines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First line contains three space separated integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($\minn \leq n\leq \maxn$, $\minm \leq m\leq \maxm$, $\mink \leq k\leq \maxk$, $k \leq n$, $k-1 \leq m$).
        \item Second line contains $n$ non-decreasing elements of the first sequence. Each element is an integer between $\mina$ and $\maxa$.
        \item Third line contains $m$ non-decreasing elements of the second sequence. Each element is an integer between $\mina$ and $\maxa$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
    Print one integer number: the largest possible minimal difference between the elements of the resulting sequence. If the non-decreasing sequence can't be built, print $-1$.
\end{Output}
