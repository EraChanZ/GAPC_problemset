Sequences are exciting, and they become even more exciting when you merge them together!

You are given two increasing sequences of integers with sizes $n$ and $m$. You want the merge their elements into a new sequence in the following way:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Choose $k$ elements from the first sequence and $k-1$ elements from the second sequence
    \item Join the chosen elements so that they interleave, like A B A B A B A
    \item The resulting elements should form an increasing sequence
\end{itemize}

After the merge you want the resulting elements to be as far from each other as possible.

Find the largest possible minimal difference between any two resulting elements. If it's not possible to form any increasing sequence, print $-1$.

\begin{Input}
    The input consists of three lines:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First line contains three space separated integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($\minn \leq n\leq \maxn$, $\minm \leq m\leq \maxm$, $\mink \leq k\leq \maxk$, $k \leq n$, $k-1 \leq m$).
        \item Second line contains $n$ increasing elements of the first sequence. Each element is an integer between $\mina$ and $\maxa$.
        \item Third line contains $m$ increasing elements of the second sequence. Each element is an integer between $\mina$ and $\maxa$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{Input}

\begin{Output}
    Print one integer number: the largest possible minimal difference between the elements of the resulting sequence. If the increasing sequence can't be built, print $-1$.
\end{Output}
