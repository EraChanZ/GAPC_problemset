Cover Delegation (Difficulty: 9-10)


Cover student association “Complaints Committee” received a lot of complaints from students about having a hard time finding new friends. So they decided to ask “ActiviTee” committee to organise a speed-dating event on which pairs of students will get to know each other, but as time and resources are limited only K speed datings are allowed. Final goal of this event is to make all the students of FSE to get to know each other. To model that, it was decided that each week (starting right after dating night) a person gets to know all the people that met with people that this person already knows, or in another words a person become friends, with the friends of his friends. To model this situation Complaints Committee decided to ask DataDump committee to load instagram data about all the students in FSE, and understand who is friend of who. And now given a model, and existing friends data you as a member of “Fully connected graph committee” should decide which pairs of people you should meet to minimize amount of weeks it requires for everyone to be friends with everyone. If it’s possible, output minimum amount of weeks, otherwise “IMPOSSIBLE”. 

Input format:

First line contains: N, K (Input constraints IDK)
Following N lines contains pair of numbers: 0 <= a, b < N, which represent that person with index a is a friend of a person with index b

Output format:
Minimum amount of weeks 0 <= T, or “IMPOSSIBLE”
